# Hypothesis Testing Concepts
In this project, we explore the concepts of hypothesis testing, focusing on the one-sample t-test. 
We'll use a practical example of testing whether the average weight of rats is equal to 25 kg.

## Introduction
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. 
The one-sample t-test is used to determine whether the mean of a single sample differs significantly from a known or hypothesized population mean.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of conducting a one-sample t-test and interpreting the results using a real-world example.

## Case Study: One-Sample t-test for Rat Weight

### Problem Statement
We want to test whether the average weight of rats is equal to 25 kg.

### Hypotheses
- Null Hypothesis (H0): The average weight of rats is equal to 25 kg.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The average weight of rats is not equal to 25 kg.

### Test Procedure
We will collect a sample of rat weights and perform a one-sample t-test to evaluate whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## Contents
- **Data Collection**: Collect a sample of rat weights.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform a one-sample t-test using statistical software or programming language.
- **Interpretation**: Interpret the results of the one-sample t-test and draw conclusions.

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Collect data on rat weights, ensuring that the sample is representative of the population.
2. **Data Analysis**: Perform a one-sample t-test using statistical software (e.g., R, Python, or SPSS) or programming language (e.g., R or Python).
3. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results of the t-test, considering the significance level, p-value, and confidence interval.
4. **Conclusion**: Draw conclusions based on the results and make recommendations if necessary.
